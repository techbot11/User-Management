# User-Management

In this App there are two Application 'Client' and 'Server'

Client Application is the frontend app based on react js
Server Application is the backend API based on nodejs with express framework

I have used MySql for database. .sql file is in /database dir.

To Run this app you need to install three packages file
1. 'npm install' at root directory
2. 'npm install' in /client directory
3. 'npm install' at /server directory

once this is done, you need to come to root dir. and write this cmd
'npm start' which will run both server (port: 3001) as well as client (port:3000)
